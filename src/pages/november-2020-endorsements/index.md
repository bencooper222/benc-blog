title: IL November 2020 Endorsements

spoiler: My "endorsements" in the March 2020 election.
---

These are my "endorsements" for the November 2020 IL elections. You can find the ballot I'm working
with [here](https://www.cookcountyclerk.com/service/sample-ballot/9300009/0).

The idea behind this post is that I try to put a lot of effort into voting well each election. I'm
hoping to increase the returns on that work by helping others with their voting[^1].

I also published my endorsements in March. I got about 63 unique pageviews on that with an average
visit time of about six minutes which I'm hoping is a sign that some people found value in my
endorsements.

While reading this, keep in mind that I call these endorsements for a reason: they're the
distillation of my values into a binary choices between imperfect candidates. Politics is hard and
there are cases where two good people with similar values can disagree. Take these endorsements with
that in mind.

Before we start, I want to enumerate my values so people know where I'm coming from. If you disagree
with my choices, I'm guessing it's because you disagree with my values - the nature of general
elections in a super blue state means that the ideological difference between opposing candidates is
vast and it's harder to vote on things like competency (that's for primaries).

- I'm a progressive Democrat and I like the Democratic Party.
- I define that progressivism in terms of net benefit. That has a couple implications:
  - I do my best to not vote on identity, but to vote on policy and electability.
  - I sometimes make compromises that leave a bad taste in my mouth but I think will lead to more
    progressive policy overall.
- Somewhat paradoxically, I'm one of those high information/involvement voters that political
  scientists have established vote more on identity rather than personal interest (I'm very happy to
  raise my own taxes). I do my best to align my identity with what I think the best policy for my
  values are. This fails sometimes.
- I think politics and policy are really tough. They involve unhappy compromises. People who pretend
  they have a magic bullet to solve our current quagmire are probably wrong.

This guide was distilled from reading the Chicago Tribune's endorsements, the Chicago Sun-Times'
endorsements, the Daily Herald's endorsements and my own eclectic knowledge of politics.

Let's get into it.

# Not-Judges

## President and Vice President

Frankly, if you disagree with me on this, I don't think the rest of this guide will be very useful
for you.

Endorsement: Joseph R. Biden & Kamala D. Harris

## United States Senator

This isn't really a competitive race so it doesn't super matter. Dick Durbin being in the Dem Senate
Leadership is good for Illinois. I wish he had faced a real primary - the nature of IL is that his
opponents in the general election are jokes.

Endorsement: Richard J. Durbin

## US Representative, 8th District

This also isn't a competitive race. There is no Republican candidate and the Libertarian candidate
said "Hillary was not locked up, or even properly INVESTIGATED" in his Sun-Times endorsement
interview.

Endorsement: Raja Krishnamoorthi

## State Senator, 28th District

Laura Murphy is unopposed. What I wrote for her unopposed primary still holds true:

> As a member of IL legislative leadership, a good rule of thumb is that she's not great. Laura
> Murphy doesn't disappoint. She has been part of IL's mismanagement of the state.

As in the primary, I will use the luxury of a protest vote.

Endorsement: No one.

## State Representative, 56th District

[^1]: Insert spiel about zero marginal costs.
[^2]:

  He actually has some good ideas like ending qualified immunity and banning cigarettes but he's
  mostly a loon.
